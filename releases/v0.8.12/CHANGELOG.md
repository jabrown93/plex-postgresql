## [0.8.12] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: std::bad_cast exception in TV shows endpoint** - MetadataCounterCache rebuild crash
  - ROOT CAUSE: Plex's SOCI version has bug with BIGINT aggregate functions in row access
  - Sequence: count() returns BIGINT (OID 20) → declared as "BIGINT" → SOCI uses column_text() → parses as integer → row.get<int64_t>() → std::bad_cast
  - SOCI's SQLite backend in Plex uses column_text() for ALL integer types, not column_int64()
  - Type checking during text-to-int conversion fails for aggregate BIGINT values
  - Impact: TV shows endpoint returned HTTP 500, "Exception handled: std::bad_cast"
  - Solution: Force aggregate functions (count, sum, max, min, avg) to declare as TEXT type
  - SOCI accepts TEXT → integer conversion without strict type checking
  - Workaround in `column_decltype()` detects aggregate column names and returns "TEXT"
  - Files: `db_interpose_column.c` (line 1573), `pg_statement.c` (improved type mappings)
  - Related: SOCI Issue #1190 (identical bug, fixed in SOCI 4.1.0)
  
- **Improved PostgreSQL type mappings** - Correct BIGINT decltype declaration
  - INT2 (OID 21) → "INTEGER" (unchanged for SOCI compatibility)
  - INT4 (OID 23) → "INTEGER" (unchanged, correct)
  - INT8 (OID 20) → "BIGINT" (was "INTEGER", now correct)
  - File: `pg_statement.c` (pg_oid_to_sqlite_decltype function)
  - Note: SMALLINT not used due to SOCI compatibility issues

## [0.8.10] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: INSERT...RETURNING lastval() transaction boundary bug** - playQueues 500 errors (final fix)
  - ROOT CAUSE: `lastval()` only works within the same transaction, but libpq uses autocommit mode
  - Sequence: INSERT...RETURNING executes in transaction T1 → commits → lastval() queries in transaction T2 → fails
  - PostgreSQL closes transaction after each PQexec() in autocommit mode
  - `lastval()` error: "lastval is not yet defined in this session" or returns stale values
  - Solution: Capture RETURNING id immediately and store in `pg_connection_t->last_insert_rowid`
  - Modified `last_insert_rowid()` to return stored value instead of calling `lastval()`
  - Stores ID in all three paths: prepared statements, cached statements, and direct exec
  - Files: `db_interpose_step.c` (2 locations), `db_interpose_exec.c`, `db_interpose_metadata.c`

- **CRITICAL: Explicit transaction handling implementation** - Root cause fix for transaction data loss
  - ROOT CAUSE: BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK were skipped as no-ops, PostgreSQL never received them
  - Plex sends: BEGIN → INSERT → COMMIT, but shim executed: (skip) → INSERT → (skip)
  - PostgreSQL used implicit transaction mode, transactions never committed
  - Data appeared to succeed (lastval() worked) but was rolled back on connection reuse
  - Solution: Removed transaction commands from skip patterns, implemented explicit execution
  - Added `is_transaction_command()` to detect BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK
  - Execute transaction commands on PostgreSQL in `db_interpose_exec.c`
  - Track transaction state in `pg_connection_t.in_transaction` field
  - Files: `pg_config.c`, `pg_config.h`, `db_interpose_exec.c`, `db_interpose_prepare.c`

- **CRITICAL: Connection mismatch in lastval()** - Wrong sequence values returned from different connection
  - Root cause: INSERT uses `pg_get_thread_connection()` but `lastval()` used `pg_find_connection()`
  - Between INSERT and lastval(), pool state can change (thread steals slot, cache invalidated, etc.)
  - Result: INSERT on connection A succeeds, `lastval()` queries connection B, returns wrong ID
  - Solution: Use `pg_get_thread_connection()` for metadata functions on library.db
  - Modified `my_sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()`, `my_sqlite3_changes()`, `my_sqlite3_changes64()`
  - Guarantees same thread-local connection for INSERT and metadata retrieval

### Changed
- Transaction commands (BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK) now executed on PostgreSQL instead of skipped
- Transaction state tracking via `in_transaction` field in connection structure
- Metadata functions (`lastval()`, `changes()`) now use thread-local connection for library.db
- Ensures transaction consistency across all operations in a single thread

### Technical Notes
- v0.8.10 implements explicit transaction handling (ROOT CAUSE fix)
- Complements v0.8.9.6 (pool reuse) and v0.8.9.7 (connection mismatch) fixes
- All three fixes work together for complete transaction correctness

## [0.8.9.6] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Uncommitted transactions lost on connection pool reuse** - playQueues 500 errors
  - Root cause: PQreset() in PHASE 2 of `pool_get_connection()` aborts uncommitted transactions
  - Sequence: Thread A INSERTs -> releases connection -> Thread B reuses -> PQreset() rolls back
  - lastval() succeeds (sequence persists) but actual INSERT data is rolled back
  - Result: 404 on subsequent GET requests despite successful lastval() return
  - Solution: Check PQtransactionStatus() and COMMIT before releasing connection (pg_close_pool_for_db)
  - Defense-in-depth: Also check and COMMIT before PQreset() in PHASE 2 reuse
  - PostgreSQL implicit transactions now properly committed before pool slot release

### Changed
- `pg_close_pool_for_db()` now commits pending transactions before marking slot as SLOT_FREE
- `pool_get_connection()` PHASE 2 now commits pending transactions before PQreset()

## [0.8.9.5] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **Row index -1 out of bounds error** - libpq "row number -1 is out of range" error
  - Root cause: WRITE statements with RETURNING set `current_row = -1`
  - Column functions using fake values could access libpq with invalid row index
  - Added `row_idx >= 0` check to all fake value access points
  - Column functions now handle all PostgreSQL statements properly (not just those with results)

- **INSERT...RETURNING result storage causing issues**
  - Don't store RETURNING result for WRITE statements
  - SOCI uses `lastval()` via SQL translation, not the RETURNING columns
  - Prevents confusion from mixing WRITE and READ result handling

### Changed
- Column functions now use simpler `pg_stmt->is_pg` check instead of `is_pg == 2 || (is_pg == 1 && result)`
- This ensures proper fallback behavior for all PostgreSQL-intercepted statements

## [0.8.9.1] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed
- **Memory corruption when clearing metadata results** - Race condition in PQclear()
  - Root cause: v0.8.9's `clear_metadata_result_if_needed()` called `PQclear()` during bind operations
  - This caused race conditions when multiple threads accessed the same prepared statement result
  - Crash in libpq's `resetPQExpBuffer` with corrupted address `0x4d55545a00000000` (ASCII "MUTZ")
  - Solution: Don't call `PQclear()` in bind functions - set `metadata_only_result = 2` instead
  - Actual cleanup now handled safely in `step()` where proper locking is in place

### Changed
- `clear_metadata_result_if_needed()` now sets flag to 2 instead of calling PQclear()
- `step()` checks for `metadata_only_result == 2` to safely cleanup and re-execute

## [0.8.9] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Metadata-only results blocking step() re-execution** - "Step didn't return row" errors
  - Root cause: `ensure_pg_result_for_metadata()` executed queries BEFORE parameters were bound
  - This cached 0-row results, and `step()` saw the cached result instead of re-executing
  - Solution: Added `metadata_only_result` flag to track pre-step execution
  - Bind functions now clear this cached result via `clear_metadata_result_if_needed()`
  - `step()` properly re-executes with bound parameters

### Changed
- All 9 bind functions now call `clear_metadata_result_if_needed()` before binding
- `ensure_pg_result_for_metadata()` sets `metadata_only_result = 1` flag
- `step()` clears the flag after successful execution

## [0.8.8] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Bind functions not checking cached statement registry** - Race condition for cached statements
  - Root cause: `pg_find_stmt()` only checked primary registry, returning NULL for cached statements
  - This caused bind operations on cached statements to have no mutex protection
  - Solution: Use `pg_find_any_stmt()` which checks BOTH primary and cached registries
  - Applied to all 9 bind functions for consistent thread-safety

- **Auto-reset busy statements before binding**
  - Added `ensure_stmt_not_busy()` helper to auto-reset statements that are still in-use
  - Prevents SQLITE_MISUSE (21) "bind on busy prepared statement" errors
  - Called before every bind operation

## [0.8.7] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Deadlock when bind/reset trigger column functions** - std::exception crashes
  - Root cause: Non-recursive mutex caused deadlock when bind/reset internally triggered column operations
  - Solution: Use `PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE` for statement mutex
  - Allows same thread to re-lock mutex without deadlock

## [0.8.6] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Thread-safety race condition in reset/clear_bindings** - Additional "bind on busy prepared statement" fix
  - Root cause: `sqlite3_reset()` and `sqlite3_clear_bindings()` released mutex BEFORE calling original SQLite
  - Solution: Hold mutex during entire `orig_sqlite3_reset()` and `orig_sqlite3_clear_bindings()` calls
  - Completes thread-safety fix started in v0.8.5

## [0.8.5] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- **Thread-safety race condition in bind operations** - "bind on busy prepared statement" errors
  - Root cause: Mutex was acquired AFTER calling SQLite, not before
  - Solution: Lock mutex BEFORE calling `orig_sqlite3_bind_*()` in all 9 bind functions
  - Prevents concurrent access when Thread A is stepping while Thread B is binding

- **lastval() error causing 500 on playQueues** - PostgreSQL error when no INSERT done yet
  - Root cause: `sqlite3_last_insert_rowid()` called `SELECT lastval()` which fails if no INSERT
  - Solution: Gracefully return 0 (like SQLite does) instead of propagating error

### Changed
- `make macos` now auto-cleans before building to prevent corrupt object files

## [0.8.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixed
- **std::bad_cast exceptions** - SOCI ORM type conversion failures caused 500 errors
  - Root cause: `column_decltype()` returned NULL, causing SOCI type mismatch
  - Solution: Map PostgreSQL OIDs to SQLite-compatible type strings (INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB)
  - Types now match what `column_type()` returns, ensuring SOCI consistency

### Added
- **Robust C++ exception handler** (Linux only):
  - Per-exception-type tracking with stack traces for first occurrence of each type
  - Automatic source detection: "SHIM-RELATED" vs "external C++ code"
  - Library identification via `dladdr()` runtime linker
  - C++ symbol demangling via `__cxa_demangle`
  - Manual `/proc/self/maps` parsing (musl-compatible, no sscanf)
  - Throttling after 50 exceptions with type summary
- **musl build script** (`build_shim_musl.sh`) for Alpine/musl-based containers

### Changed
- Exception context tracking uses volatile globals instead of TLS (musl compatibility)
- Stack frame collection works on both ARM64 and x86_64

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-10
